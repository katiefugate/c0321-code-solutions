USER CAN SIGN UP

When a user provides a username and password on the sign up page and submits the
form, the onClick prop of the AuthForm React element gets called, which calls
the handleSubmit method of the AuthForm component. In the handleSubmit method
it sends a POST fetch request to the server with the forms inputs.

The server takes the username and password from the fetch request, checks if
both username and password were provided, throws an error if not, and if they
are it querys the database to insert a new user into the users table and responds
to the client with a 201 status and the new userId, username, and createdAt in
JSON.

When the client recieces the JSON response, it parses it, then updates the hash
property of the location propery of the window object to redirect the page to
the sign in form.


USER CAN SIGN IN

When a user provides an email and password on the sign in page and submits the
form, the onClick prop of the AuthForm React element gets called, which calls the
handleSubmit method of the Authform component. In the handleSubmit method,
it sends a POST fetch request to the server with the form inputs

when the server gets the request it checks if both username and password are
provided, and throws an error if not, if they are it querys the database to select
the userId and hashedPassword from the users table where the username matches the
one from the request. If the user wasnt found, it throws an error, if it was, it
checks the password from the request against the hashedPassword from the database,
if they dont match it throws an error, and if they do it creates a token for the
user, and responds to the client with the token, userId, and username in JSON.

when the client recieves the response, it parses the JSON and calls the OnSignIn
prop on the AuthForm React element, which takes the token from the response,
and sets it to localStorage, and updates the user state of the App component
to the user from the response.


USER CAN STAY SIGNED IN (EVEN IF THEY REFRESH THE PAGE)

If the user refreshes the page the app checks localStorage for a token, if there
isnt one is updates the state to null and renders the sign in page, if there is
it updates it to the token, and re-renders the page.


USER CAN SIGN OUT

When a user clicks the sign out button the app removes their token from localStorage,
and updates the user property of the state to null, and re-renders the page
to the sign in page.
